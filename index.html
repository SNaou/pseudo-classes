            <p> There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. 
                The current count orbiting our star:

                title="Overview all eight planets"> Eight</a> 
                The inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. NASA's newest rover — Perseverance — 
                landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.
                Beyond Neptune, a newer class of smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including longtime favorite Pluto. 
                Thousands more planets have been discovered beyond our solar system. Scientists call them exoplanets 
                (exo means "from outside").

                   It says a planet must do three things:
                   It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun).
                   It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.
                   It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun.
                   Discussion—and debate—will continue as our view of the cosmos continues to expand.

        <h2> What is a planet? </h2>
            <p>This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer. Everyone knows that Earth, 
                Mars and Jupiter are planets. But both Pluto and Ceres were once considered planets until new discoveries 
                triggered scientific debate about how to best describe them—a vigorous debate that continues to this day. 
                The most recent definition of a planet was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.

              <h3>The Scientific Process</h3>
              <p>Science is a dynamic process of questioning, hypothesizing, discovering, and changing previous ideas based on what 
                is learned. Scientific ideas are developed through reasoning and tested against observations. Scientists assess and 
                question each other's work in a critical process called peer review.

                Our understanding about the universe and our place in it has changed over time. New information can cause us to 
                rethink what we know and reevaluate how we classify objects in order to better understand them. New ideas and perspectives 
                can come from questioning a theory or seeing where a classification breaks down.</p>
